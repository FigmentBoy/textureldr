TODO:

add a background or something lol

find out why CCSprite::setColor ends up with cocos not being able to draw the node correctly

iterate through directories to determine which detail level each pack supports

add warning for packs that don't have .fnt/.plist files for corresponding .pngs, to warn of potential garbled packs

hook CCKeyboardDispatcher::dispatchKeyboardMSG for shortcut

rewrite with cocos headers at some point, makes things much easier

add safeguards for invalid folder names (since GD only allows english characters, and fmod crashes with non-english folder names sometimes)
