# textureldr
open source, integrated texture pack management system for geometry dash

# note
not stable. please do not download this if you are not willing to take risks with geometry dash.

# known issues
- pressing escape on the creator layer, level layer, or garage layer will cause the textureldr button not to appear on the menu layer.
- the textureldr button still appears after ejecting the dll. clicking the button will cause the game to crash, as the game is trying to access deallocated memory. (same goes for ejecting while inside of the menu)

# to do
see todo.txt.
