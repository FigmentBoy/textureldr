# textureldr
open source, integrated texture pack management system for geometry dash

# note
not stable. please do not download this if you are not willing to take risks with geometry dash.

# known issues
- the textureldr button still appears after ejecting the dll. clicking the button will cause the game to crash, as the game is trying to access deallocated memory. (same goes for ejecting while inside of the loader menu)
- it's ugly.

# to do
see todo.txt.

# usage
- download the .dll in releases (to the right)
- inject it with some dll injector (mega hack provides one, or you can use another one if you'd like more options)
- find the "packs" folder in the directory where your geometry dash exe is. drag in a folder with the textures you'd like to use in-game.
- click the folder button that is now in place of the "more games" button.
- select a texture pack and click the apply button!


# thanks
thank you to absolute, italian apk downloader, and many others from the GD programming server for helping me in my learning process. especially italian apk downloader, who released a repo of all the decompiled gd classes, which was super helpful while attempting to reverse the required functionality.
